# assortedRFunctions

This is just a random collection of functions for R

## Notes
- In Version >= 1.1.1 `getAngleInDegreesFromPoint()` was significantly changed because for certain angles, the function did not only give values between 0 and 360. 
- From Version 1.2.0 onward, I am following Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 (https://semver.org/)
